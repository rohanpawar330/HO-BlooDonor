Following are the steps to sync your development branch with master. I have tested this by performing these steps and verifying that my development branch was brought in sync with master.
skip the first step if you already created you're branch.

1. switch to master
git checkout master

2. update master
git pull origin master

3. switch back to your own branch
git checkout rohan-development

4. Rebase your branch
git rebase origin/master

***
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
[odev@localhost wms-vbcs-mobile]$ git fetch origin; git reset --hard origin/master
***
--------------------------
only when conflict.
5. If any conflicts arise from step 4, resolve them manually. If conflicts were present, run the following after they have been resolved. If no conflicts were present, move to step 5.
git rebase --continue
--------------------------

6. Push your branch changes to remote branch
git push --force
After step 6 your  branch should be in sync with master. I will go over them on the call tomorrow.
Do not run  git merge master.
